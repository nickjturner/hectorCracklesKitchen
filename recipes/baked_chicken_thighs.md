A simple guide to perfectly baked chicken thighs. 

## Ingredients:
- Chicken thighs
- Oil
- Seasoning of choice

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 400F.
2. Leave tray in the oven during heating, to give the thigh crispy skin.
3. Rub some oil and your seasoning of choice into the chicken thighs.
4. Place thighs in the tray skin down.
