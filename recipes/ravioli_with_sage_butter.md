A simple and delicious ravioli dish with sage butter sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 9 oz ravioli
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup walnuts, chopped
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 teaspoon dried sage
- 1/4 lb fresh spinach
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan

## Steps
1. Bring a pot of water to a boil for the ravioli. Cook until tender, reserve 1/4 cup of the cooking water, then drain.
2. Mince the garlic and chop the walnuts before preparing the sage butter sauce.
3. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat, stirring continuously. Once it sizzles and becomes foamy, add the garlic and walnuts. Cook until the sediment turns deep golden brown, then remove from heat and stir in the sage.
4. Add the spinach and reserved cooking water to the skillet. Return to low heat and stir until the spinach is wilted. Add salt to taste.
5. Toss the cooked ravioli in the skillet with the sauce. Serve with grated Parmesan and freshly cracked pepper.
