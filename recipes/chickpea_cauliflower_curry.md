A flavorful vegetarian curry with chickpeas and cauliflower.

## Ingredients:
- Masala Spice Mix
    - 2 tablespoons garam masala
    - 1/2 teaspoon cumin
    - 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
    - 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
    - 1/4 teaspoon cayenne
    - 1/2 teaspoon salt
    - freshly cracked pepper
- Skillet Ingredients
    - 1 yellow onion
    - 3 cloves garlic
    - 1/2 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
    - 2 tablespoons olive oil
    - 12 oz frozen cauliflower florets
    - 1 (15 oz) can chickpeas, drained
    - 1 (15 oz) can tomato sauce
    - 1/4 cup water
    - 1/3 cup heavy cream
    - salt to taste
    
## Steps
1. Combine the spices for the masala spice mix in a small bowl.
2. Finely dice the onion, mince the garlic, and grate the ginger. Add them to a large skillet with olive oil and sauté over medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent (about 3 minutes). Add the spice mix and sauté for one more minute.
3. Add the frozen cauliflower florets to the skillet and continue to sauté for about 5 minutes, or until the cauliflower is thawed and coated in spices.
4. Add the drained chickpeas, tomato sauce, and 1/4 cup water to the skillet. Stir to combine, then simmer over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add more water if the mixture becomes too dry.
5. Turn off the heat and stir in the heavy cream. Taste and adjust salt as needed. Serve over rice or with bread for dipping.
