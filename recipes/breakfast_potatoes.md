name: Breakfast Potatoes

## Ingredients
- 1 pound red potatoes (scrubbed clean and dried)
- 3-4 Tbsp vegan butter (or olive oil)
- 1 tsp sea salt
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp ground black pepper

## Steps
1. Heat a skillet to medium heat, or an electric skillet to 350 degrees F (176 C).
2. Bake your potatoes in the microwave for 4-6 minutes total (flipping once halfway through) until they have a little give when squeezed. Alternatively, bake them in a 400-degree F (204 C) oven placed directly on the rack for roughly 20-35 minutes, depending on their size, until soft to the touch.
3. Cut cooked potatoes into bite-sized pieces (I usually quarter mine), and place vegan butter 1 Tbsp at a time onto the hot skillet. Only add enough to accommodate all of your potatoes.
4. TIP: Place potatoes, one by one, onto the skillet directly in the melted butter ensuring both exposed cut sides touch the butter. This will ensure all sides get crispy brown.
5. Once all potatoes are on the skillet, spray the top with avocado or olive oil (optional) and season with half of the seasonings. Spraying them with oil helps the seasonings stick to the skin.
6. After about 4 minutes, use a fork or spatula to tip the potato over onto its other side to brown evenly.
7. After another 3-4 minutes, flip the potatoes on their backsides (skin side down) and season with remaining salt, pepper and garlic powder. Cook for another 2-4 minutes until crispy and golden brown on all sides.
