    ingredients:
      - 2 tablespoons garam masala
      - 1/2 teaspoon cumin
      - 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
      - 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
      - 1/4 teaspoon cayenne
      - 1/2 teaspoon salt
      - freshly cracked pepper
  - name: Skillet Ingredients
    ingredients:
      - 1 yellow onion
      - 3 cloves garlic
      - 1/2 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
      - 2 tablespoons olive oil
      - 12 oz frozen cauliflower florets
      - 1 (15 oz) can chickpeas, drained
      - 1 (15 oz) can tomato sauce
      - 1/4 cup water
      - 1/3 cup heavy cream
      - salt to taste
steps:
  - Combine the spices for the masala spice mix in a small bowl.
  - Finely dice the onion, mince the garlic, and grate the ginger. Add them to a large skillet with olive oil and sauté over medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent (about 3 minutes). Add the spice mix and sauté for one more minute.
  - Add the frozen cauliflower florets to the skillet and continue to sauté for about 5 minutes, or until the cauliflower is thawed and coated in spices.
  - Add the drained chickpeas, tomato sauce, and 1/4 cup water to the skillet. Stir to combine, then simmer over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add more water if the mixture becomes too dry.
  - Turn off the heat and stir in the heavy cream. Taste and adjust salt as needed. Serve over rice or with bread for dipping.
