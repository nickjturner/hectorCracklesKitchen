name: Spanish Chicken with Butter Beans, Chorizo, and Tomatoes
ingredients:
  - 4 part-boned chicken breasts, skin on
  - 8oz (225g) dried butter beans, soaked overnight (or a tin)
  - 2 tbsps olive oil
  - 6oz (175g) chorizo sausage (raw is best)
  - 14oz (400g) tin chopped plum tomatoes
  - A few sprigs of thyme
  - 2 bay leaves
  - 1 medium onion
  - 2 medium carrots
  - 1 medium leek
  - 2 celery sticks
  - 1 tsp smoked paprika
  - 3 cloves garlic, chopped
  - Saffron stamens, a good pinch
  - 10 fl oz (275ml) hot vegetable or chicken stock
  - 2 tbsps chopped fresh parsley
  - Salt and pepper
instructions:
  - Peel onion and carrots and chop them finely.
  - Take rough green ends off leek, make a vertical split, and wash thoroughly. Slice leek lengthways and finely chop.
  - Chop celery sticks.
  - Heat 1 tsp of olive oil in a casserole dish and brown the chicken breasts on both sides until golden brown. Transfer chicken to a plate and add the rest of the oil to the casserole.
  - Stir in onions, carrots, leek, celery, and cook over a low heat, covered with a lid, to allow vegetables to sweat in their own juices for 10-15 minutes or until they begin to soften.
  - Prepare the chorizo while this is happening. Peel off skin and cut into small pieces before stirring into vegetables with smoked paprika.
  - Turn heat to medium and cook everything together for 2-3 minutes to draw fat from chorizo. Stir constantly.
  - Add beans, garlic, tomatoes, bay leaf, and saffron, followed by hot stock.
  - Season with black pepper.
  - Place chicken breasts on top, bring to simmering point, reduce heat to low, and leave to simmer, covered, for 20â€“25 minutes.
  - Stir parsley into sauce after chicken breasts are transferred to plates. Spoon over.
  - Serve with arugula salad.
