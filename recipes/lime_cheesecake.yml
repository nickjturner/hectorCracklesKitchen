ingredients:
  - 250g graham crackers
  - 125g unsalted butter, melted
  - 400g cream cheese
  - 66g icing sugar
  - 2 limes
  - 200ml heavy whipping cream
instructions:
  - Whizz the crackers to crumbs in a food processor, or tip into a food bag and crush with a rolling pin. Mix with the melted butter, then press into the base of a 20cm springform cake tin. Chill in the fridge until needed.
  - Put the cream cheese, icing sugar, lime zest, and juice from one lime in a bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth.
  - Whisk the heavy whipping cream until it forms soft peaks. Then tip the heavy whipping cream into the cream cheese mix and continue beating until completely combined.
