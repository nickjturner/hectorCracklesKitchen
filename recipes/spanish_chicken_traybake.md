A flavorful and easy chicken traybake with Mediterranean ingredients.

## Ingredients
- 4 fat garlic cloves
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, plus a few sprigs
- 4 teaspoons rapeseed or olive oil
- 8 chicken thighs on the bone, excess skin trimmed
- 700g mixed peppers, halved and deseeded
- 140g piece of chorizo, roughly chopped
- 20 pitted black olives
- 200g cherry tomatoes
- 3 tablespoons sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar
- crusty bread, pasta, or potatoes, to serve

## Steps
1. Preheat oven to 200°C (180°C fan/gas 6).
2. Using a pestle and mortar, crush garlic and thyme leaves with seasoning and 2 teaspoons oil to make a paste. Alternatively, finely grate the garlic and mix.
3. Rub the paste on the underside of the chicken.
4. Cut pepper halves into strips and place in a large roasting tin with chorizo and olives. Toss with remaining oil, then place chicken on top, skin-side up. Scatter tomatoes, spoon over vinegar, season, and tuck in thyme sprigs.
5. Roast for 1 hour until chicken skin is crispy and vegetables are softened. Serve with crusty bread, pasta, or potatoes.
