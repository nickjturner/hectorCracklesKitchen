name: Tandoori Chicken
ingredients:
  - 3 Tbsp vegetable oil
  - 3 Tbsp tandoori spice mix
  - 1 cup plain yogurt
  - 2 Tbsp lemon juice
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 4 whole chicken breasts
steps:
  - Heat the oil in a small pan over medium heat, then cook the coriander, cumin, turmeric, cayenne, garam masala, and paprika, stirring often, until fragrant (approximately 2-3 minutes). Let cool completely.
  - Whisk the cooled spice-oil mixture into the yogurt, then mix in the lemon juice, garlic, salt, and ginger.
  - Cut deep slashes (to the bone) in 3-4 places on the leg/thigh pieces. Coat the chicken in the marinade, cover, and chill for at least an hour (preferably 6 hours), no more than 8 hours.
  - Prepare your grill so that one side is quite hot over direct heat, the other side cooler, not over direct heat. If using charcoal, leave one side of the grill without coals, so you have a hot side and a cooler side. If you are using a gas grill, just turn on one-half of the burners.
  - Use tongs to wipe the grill grates with a paper towel soaked in vegetable oil.
  - Take the chicken out of the marinade and shake off the excess. You want the chicken coated, but not gloppy.
